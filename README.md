# Data Cleaning - EDA on Retail Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding and analyzing any dataset, including a retail dataset. Here are several reasons why conducting EDA on a retail dataset is beneficial:

Understand the Data Structure:
EDA helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure of the retail dataset. You can explore the number of rows and columns, data types, and overall data distribution.

Identify Missing Values:
EDA allows you to identify missing values in the dataset. Knowing where data is missing is crucial for making informed decisions about data imputation or handling missing values appropriately.

Detect Outliers:
Outliers can significantly impact analysis and modeling. EDA helps in identifying and understanding outliers in the retail data, enabling you to decide whether to remove or handle them in a specific way.

Support Decision-Making:
EDA provides valuable insights that can inform business decisions. For example, it might help in optimizing pricing strategies, inventory management, or marketing campaigns.

In summary, conducting EDA on a retail dataset is essential for gaining insights, addressing data quality issues, and making informed decisions. It sets the foundation for subsequent data modeling and analysis tasks, enabling more accurate and meaningful results.
